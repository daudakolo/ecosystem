# GlueX Ecosystem Directory

This repository powers the **GlueX Ecosystem UI**, a visual and searchable directory of protocols that are:

- Integrated into the GlueX Execution or Data Layer (via Liquidity Modules or Kernels)
- Building on top of GlueX APIs (e.g. Router API, Exchange Rates API, Widget)
- Actively contributing to the GlueX ecosystem through usage, collaboration, or development

---

## Purpose

The GlueX Ecosystem UI exists to provide users, developers, and partners with:

- A transparent view of which protocols are currently live on GlueX
- Insight into which protocols are using GlueX infrastructure for execution and data
- A discovery layer for exploring projects powered by GlueX across chains and verticals

---

## Structure

This repository contains:

- `data/` – JSON files listing integrated protocols with metadata (name, logo, category, links, chains, etc.)
- `ui/` – Frontend code for the GlueX Ecosystem interface (React/Next.js or similar)
